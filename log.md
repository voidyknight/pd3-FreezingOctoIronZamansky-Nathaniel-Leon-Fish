FISH: worked on maps

6/3/14<br>
FISH: worked on map5, started teacher subclasses

6/6/14<br>
FISH: finished map5, created map class

6/8/14<br>
FISH: ok so I finished the map file reading in stuff. In order to do this I added some new code to the submonster classes (Virus, Rumba and FreezingOctoIronZamansky). Also fyi Tim you mispelled Zamansky like Zanamsky or something and my code wasn't working for like 20 minutes and I was going insane trying to figure out what was wrong. Also I made some minor changes to Player.

FISH: oof just finished a ~3 hr coding marathon. Saying that the processing editing interface is bad is an understatement. Anyhoo, I wrote some processing code that reads a text file and displays it in a colorful fashion. The next step would be to translate the "cells" into their respective class types (player, monster...). Also, for some reason the maps look a bit distorted. Also, keyboard input.
